#### Choice Set
What one considers hiring to overcome their constraints, and make progress towards their desired state.

* *Sleeping pills.*
* *Meditate.*
* *Listen to podcast.*
* *Listen to music.*

* *Excercise for 60 min. during the day.*
* *Use a white noise sound machine.*
* *Wear an eyemask.*

----

#### Constraints
What prevents us from fulfilling those unmet goals: actualization gap.

* *My spouse snores.*
* *I'm sensitive to loud noises.*
* *My bedroom has lots of light coming in.*
* *It's difficult for me to wind down negative (anxiety) thoughts.*

***Constraint Types***

[x]  Anxiety: Concern about undesirable things happening.

[ ]  Lack of skill: Lacking the knowledge to understand something or lacking the physical capability to execute.

[ ]  Switching cost: A perception that making a change is too much effort, or will not be worth it.

[x]  Habit: Mental schemas and physical behaviors that one is accustomed to, that are hard to unlearn/give up.

[ ]  Functional dependency: The new way must interact with related, but separate, product or behavior that is also consumed.

[ ]  Money: Lack of accessible funds.

[ ]  Time: Perception that the investment in time (effort) is not worth it.

[ ]  Situational barrier: Attributes of the current environment that are outside of the consumer's control.

[ ]  Organizational barrier: Attributes of the current work environment that are outside of the consumer's control.

----

#### Catalysts
Events that create or affect unmet goals, constraints, and choice set:

* *An upcoming public speaking event is introducing anxiety. This is making it hard to fall asleep, and stay asleep.*
* *I have a history of intermittent insomnia.*

***Catalyst Types***

[x]  Anticipated event: Expecting that something will happen.

[ ]  Unexpected event: Something happened that caught you by surprise.

[ ]  Related event: Something that has happened in the past, has happened again.

[ ]  Advertisement: Promotional content intended to inform consumers of a product and/or persuade them to use it.

[ ]  Word of mouth: First-hand information gained from someone.

[ ]  Observed use: Seeing someone using something that was previously unknown to you.

[ ]  Positive experience with product: Consumption of a product has made the consumer believe progress is likely.

[ ]  Negative experience with product: Consumption of a product has made the consumer believe progress is not likely.

[ ]  Made progress: Getting closer to having a Job to be Done, become Done.

[ ]  Job became Done: Job is Done. The desired progress was made.

[ ]  Lower-order Job-to-be-Done: Seeking progress somewhere else, causes the desire for progress elsewhere.

***II. Choice Set Assessment***
----
#### Shopping [ ]
Shopping is when having an idea of the positive change you seek and use help to shape up what progress is/isn't possible and what solutions you can use to make that progress. 

#### Re-invention [ ]
Re-invention is when trying out solutions you already have access to and seeing if it delivers your desired progress.

#### Tradeoff assessment [x]
Tradeoff assessment is when thinking about what to hire for your Job to be Done. What you are willing to give up, what you are not willing to give up, your willingness to pay (time, money, effort, ...).

*What to hire to overcome insomnia the night before a major event.*
