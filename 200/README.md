# 200 - Jobs-to-be-Done in Agile

***What is a Theme / Initiative?***
Think of it as long-term objectives with a broader focus that will have the most significant impact on your company's performance.

***What is an Epic / Project?***
The epics in Agile are a collection of multiple tasks or user stories. They are usually responsible for producing a major deliverable, which may include various Agile features, for example.

The project, on the other hand, is a very tensile term. If its size and scope are big, then it might include several project epics. However, people often use "project" and "epic" interchangeably. In general, you can think of them as the building blocks of Agile's initiatives and themes.

***What is a Task / User story?***
This is the smallest piece of work in the chain. It could be anything that the teams are working on (new feature, content piece, design drawing, prototype, legal document, etc.)
